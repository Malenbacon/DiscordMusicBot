a music bot using discord.js, at the moment only suport musics send by attachments in mensages (because ytdl-core is not working, when come back i want to implement youtube link support)

this is a study project, please do not try to use this bot seriously.

only the core funcionaly (play music, queue system and skip music) work like intended right now
